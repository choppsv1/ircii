Usage: @ <expression>
  The @ command evaluates the given expression in "variable
  expression" mode.  This is the same mode used inside IF ()
  and WHILE ().  Normally it is used for variable assignment
  as it provides a nicer syntax than ASSIGN does in some
  contexts.  These are the same thing:

	@ foo = [bar]
	assign foo bar

  as are these:

	@ foo = C
	assign foo $C
