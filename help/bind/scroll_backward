Usage: BIND <key> SCROLL_BACKWARD
  When SCROLL is set on, this will allow you to scroll back through
  your lastlog entries 1/2 page at a time.  The default binding for
  this is meta1-p.  A key must be bound to SCROLL_END to exit this
  (default meta1-e).  It is suggested that you have HOLD_MODE set on
  or otherwise when you get out of the history all your new messages
  will flash by.
