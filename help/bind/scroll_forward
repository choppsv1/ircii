Usage: BIND <key> SCROLL_FORWARD
  When SCROLL is set on, this will allow you to move forward through
  your lastlog entries 1/2 page at a time.  This is after you have
  entered the lastlog viewing mode with SCROLL_BACKWARD. The default
  binding for this is meta1-n  a key must be bound to SCROLL_END to
  exit this (default meta1-e).  A good way to use this is to use
  SCROLL_START and then SCROLL_FORWARD to the end of the lastlog.
  It is suggested that you have HOLD_MODE set on or otherwise when
  you get out of the history all your new messages will flash by.
