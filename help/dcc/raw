Usage: DCC RAW <fd> <host> <message>
  After a connection has been established with the $CONNECT()
  function DCC RAW is used to talk to that connection.  
  $CONNECT(HOST PORT)  returns the (fd) of the connection 
  which is then used by DCC RAW. E.g:
    ALIAS socktest ECHO $connect(host 7)
  Which will echo the file descriptor.

  Then send messages to it with:
    DCC RAW fd host message

  These will be echoed back at you by the remote host.
  Incoming messages can be intercepted with ON DCC_RAW.
