Usage: EVAL <commands>
  EVAL passes the commands through the inline parser and executes them.
  This means that variables are expanded, and ;'s are honored.  

Note:
  You HAVE to use EVAL in a script if you want it to expand 
  aliases and vars while it loads. The value of INPUT_ALIASES is
  ignored when loading scripts.

  LOAD
  SET INPUT_ALIASES
