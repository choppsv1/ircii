Usage: IGNORE [<nick>] [-|+|^][<message type>]
       IGNORE [<user@host>] [-][<message type>]

  The standard form of IGNORE allows you to specify which type of
  messages you wish to ignore from a user.  The message type
  parameter can be one of the following:
    MSGS            All MSGs received
    NOTICES         All NOTICEs received
    PUBLIC          All normal channel conversation
    INVITES         All INVITEs received
    WALLOPS         All WALLOPS received
    NOTES           All NOTEs received
    CTCP            All CTCPs received
    CRAP            Anything else
    ALL             All of the above message types
    NONE            No message types

  You can ignore by nickname or by specifying a userid@hostname
  format.  Wildcards may be used in all formats.  You can specify
  multiple types of messages to ignore on the command line.
  Preceeding a type with a - indicates removal of ignoring of
  that type of message.  For example:
    IGNORE BigCheese MSGS INVITES
  ignores MSGs and INVITES from BigCheese.  
    IGNORE *@*.cmu.edu ALL -NOTES
  ignores all types of messages except NOTES from anyone from CMU.

  You may also specify a + before any message type to cause messages
  of that type from that user to be displayed with the nickname
  highlighted.  (See SET HIGHLIGHT_CHAR) For example:
    IGNORE *Cheese* +MSGS
  will cause all MSGs from anyone with Cheese in their nickname
  to appear with their nickname highlighted.  
    IGNORE * +PUBLIC +NOTES
  will highlight all PUBLIC messages and NOTES received.  The + has no 
  effect with the user@host name format.

  If you specify a ^ before a message type, then messages from the
  matching nicknames will be displayed no matter what.  This allows
  you to exclude certain nicknames from larger matching lists.  For
  example:
    IGNORE * MSG
    IGNORE BigCheese ^MSG
  This will ignore private messages from everyone except BigCheese.
  
  All forms of IGNORE use the - to remove ignore attributes,
  and the type NONE will remove the user from the list
  completely.  

  All forms of IGNORE will match against the nickname with the
  most true matching characters.  What this means is if you have:
    IGNORE BigCheese MSGS
    IGNORE * +ALL
  Then MSG's from BigCheese will be ignored, and all other types
  of messages from BigCheese will be unaffected.  All messages
  of all types from any other user will be highlighted.
