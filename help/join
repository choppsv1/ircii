Usage: JOIN [-INVITE|<channel_list> [<key>]]
  Changes your current channel to the channel specified.
  If no parameters are given, your current channel is displayed.

  Channel names begin with a # or & and may contain any character
  except space, carriage return, null and line feed. For example,
  #My_Channel, # or #!@$%^&* are valid channel names.
  Channel names beginning with the character '&' are local to your server.

  If the specified channel does not already exist, it will be created.
  Otherwise, if MODE +k <key> is enabled on the channel, you will have to
  supply the <key> to complete join.

Available flags:
  -INVITE
    If the -INVITE switch is used, you will join the channel that you were
    last INVITED to.  Or, if we wish to be grammatically correct,
    you will join the channel to which you were last invited.

Note:
  Joining a channel does not cause you to leave your previous
  channel unless NOVICE is set to ON. See SET NOVICE
  If you have NOVICE off, it is possible to join several channels
  at the same time.. with
    JOIN #channel1,#channel2,#channel3
  You must use commas and no spaces to separate the channel names.

  CHANNEL and JOIN are identical.

See Also:
  SET NOVICE
  MODE for information about changing channel characteristics.
