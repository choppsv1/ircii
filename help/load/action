Usage: LOAD action
  Several Multi-User-Dungeon-like aliases are defined here.
  They make use of the ME command, and are transmitted to
  the current channel or the current query via CTCP ACTION.
  Some incomplete client variants might not support this type
  of communication messages.

  These commands can be used with or without an adverb of your
  choice:
	APPLAUD		BOUNCE		CHUCKLE		CLAP
	GIGGLE		GRIN		GROAN		MOAN
	NOD		PURR		SCRATCH		SHRUG
	SIGH		SMILE		WAVE		WINK
	YAWN

  These act differently depending on presence of arguments:
	LAUGH [<how>]	SING [<lyrics>]

  The following can only be used without arguments.
	BOW		BURP		COUGH		CRY
	GASP		SCREAM		SHIVER		SNAP
	SNEEZE		SNORE		WHISTLE		WIGGLE

  These instead, require a nickname as argument
  (or 'you' if you are in a /query):
	COMFORT		CUDDLE		HUG		KISS
	LOVE		PAT		POKE		SLAP
	SPIT		THANK

  These can be used with or without a nickname:
	DANCE		SHAKE

  Some of these commands use a possessive pronoun, the pronoun
  is generated at loading time depending on the setting of a
  variable 'GENDER'. If you care, you should include a line

	assign gender f

  (or 'm' for male) in your .ircrc before 'load action'.
  However sentences will make sense even if GENDER is undefined.

  New commands have been added which act like 'private-msg actions':
	PING <person> [<beeps to wake person up>]
  and	PONG <person>
