Usage: LOAD dccchan
  DCC based channels.  DCC channels work similar to other servers, except
  that they are just another channel, not a full server.  This implementation
  also has the limit of one DCC channel per client.

  To use:
    /makeid <nick>          - creates a unique nickid for you
    /openport <port>        - create a dcc channel on port <port>
    /closeport <port>       - close a dcc channel on port <port>
    /opencon <host> <port>  - connect to port <port> on host <host>
    /whoon                  - list who is on the channel

  Use the /d_msg command to send a message to the channel.  You can also use
  /query /d_msg to achieve the same
