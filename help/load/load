Usage: LOAD [-args] <filename> [<arg0> <arg1> ...]
  Loads the given file into irc, treating each line as an irc
  command, just as if it were typed into the command line, but it
  expects commands to not have leading command characters, for
  compatibility it is however allowed. LOAD is the command used
  automatically at irc startup to load the .ircrc file.

  In a LOAD script it is allowed to have leading spaces and tabs
  before the commands.

  A long line, like a long alias definition, can be split over
  multiple lines by putting { and } around it like this:
    alias follow {
      say sorry folks, got invited away
      join -i;bow
      say here i am especially for you
      grin
    }

  This format _MUST_ be used, you cannot put the { in the next
  line and you cannot put the } elsewhere than by itself.
  It is also not allowed to use { { } } constructs.

  If the -args flag is specified, then each
  line of the loaded file is alias expanded before it is executed,
  just as if you had INPUT_ALIASES set to ON.  The optional
  arguments, arg0 arg1 etc, are then used to expand the argument
  expandos ($*, $1, $2, etc) for each line.  The -args switch
  takes precedent over any changes of the setting of INPUT_ALIASES
  in the loaded file.  If you only want to expand certain lines
  and not others, use EVAL to evaluate the given line expanding 
  variables.  The default value for INPUT_ALIASES is now OFF
  when loading a script.
  Note also that the default value for DISPLAY is OFF as well.

  Commands separated by ';' are not recognized by LOAD, that syntax
  is for ALIAS, BIND and ON only.
  
  The location of scripts should be shown in your LOAD_PATH variable
  which can be changed to point to your own scripts if needed.
