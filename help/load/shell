Usage: LOAD shell
  This allows you to start a unix shell from inside IRC.  It 
  requires that the ircflush program be available and so may
  not work for everyone. The alias to start a shell will be
  simply /shell.  This starts a shell in a new window. If the
  ircflush program is not installed you will most likely see
  now output until you close the shell.  (Which is of course
  too late.)
