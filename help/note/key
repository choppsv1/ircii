Usage: NOTE KEY [&<passwd>] [+|-<flags>] [+|-<maxtime>] <nick!user@host>
  KEY is an alias for USER +KR (default max 1 day)
  This command is for allowing no-opers to use oper-options by specifying
  the flag to unlock. Be careful with this option!
  Example: KEY +365 +s * would make it possible for everybody to use s flag.

  This functionality may be restricted to IRC operators.
