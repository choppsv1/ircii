Usage: NOTE USER [&<passwd>] [+|-<flags>] [+|-<maxtime>]
		<nick!username@host> <msg>
  With USER you can queue a message in the server, and when the recipient
  signs on/off IRC, change nick or join any channel, note checks for
  valid messages. This works even if the sender is not on IRC. See HELP
  FLAGS for more info. 
  Password can be up to ten characters long. You may specify password 
  using the &, % or $ character. & is equal to to $, except working much
  better cause client use $ for other things...
  The % character works like &, except it makes the queuing silent. It
  makess also sense to use this without any following password.
  If any request queued is equal to any previous except time and maxtime,
  only maxtime is changed as specified. You then get "Joined" instead of
  "Queued". 
  HELP FLAGS for info about flag settings. Username can be specified
  without @host. Do not use wildcards in username if you know what it
  is, even if it's possible. Max time before the server automatically
  remove the message from the queue, is specified with hours with a
  '-' character first, or days if a '+' character is specified, as
  -5 hours, or +10 days. Default maxtime is 7 days.
  Note: The received message is *directly* displayed on the screen,
  without the need for a read or remove request.
    NOTE USER &secret +WN +10 Wizible!jarlek@ifi.uio.no Howdy!
  is an example of a message sent only to the specified recipient if
  this person is an operator, and after receiving the message, the server
  sends a note message back to sender to inform about the delivery.
    NOTE USER +XR -5 Anybody <ctrl-G>
  is an example which makes the server to tell when Anybody signs
  on/off irc, change nick etc. This process repeats for 5 hours.
    NOTE USER +FL @*.edu *account*
  is an example which makes the server send a message back if any real-
  name of any user matches *account*. Message is sent back as note from
  server, or directly as a notice if sender is on IRC at this time.
