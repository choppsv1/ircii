Usage: NOTICE <nickname>|<channel> <text of message>
  Sends a private message to the nicknames or list of nicknames
  specified.  Unlike MSG, no automated response messages (such as
  generated by IGNORE or an automaton) will be sent in response
  to a NOTICE.  Other than that, it's just like a MSG.

See Also:
  MSG for a description of parameters and switches.
