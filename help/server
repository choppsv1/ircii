Usage: SERVER [flags] [<name of server>|<number in server_list> [<port>]]
       SERVER <name of server>[:<port>[:<password>[:<nickname>]]]
       SERVER [+|-]
       SERVER -DELETE <number in server_list>
       SERVER -GROUP <server_group> [<name of server>|<number in server_list>]
  Switches your primary server to the server specified at the
  specified port number.   If no port number is given, the default
  port number is used.   Your channel and AWAY status will remain
  unchanged.   Occasionally, you can switch servers faster than the
  irc   network can send out the information that you have left a
  server.  So don't be surprised if it says your nickname is in 
  use...  just wait a moment and set it with NICK.  IRCII
  maintains an internal list of servers you have connected to.
  To see that list, use SERVER with no arguments.  You may also
  specify one of the servers in the server list by its number in
  the list, by issuing:
    SERVER <number in list>
  Likewise, you can automatically switch to the next or previous
  server in the server list by doing:
    SERVER + 
  or 
    SERVER - 
  to switch to the next and previous server in the list,
  respectively.  The second form allows you to specify a port,
  a password and a nickname to be used for this IRC connection.
  Also, you can set a particular server to be associated with a
  particular IRCII window.  To do this, set the current window to the
  window you wish to use and do:
    SERVER +servername
  In this case, servername may again be a name, IP address, or number
  of a server in your server list.
  This will connect you to the given server as a secondary server in
  that window.  Doing a /SERVER with no parameters will show you your
  primary server.  If you kill the last window associated with a
  server, the connection to that server will close.  If you kill the
  last window associated with your primary server, a new open server
  will be chosen as the primary server.  If there are open servers you
  will not be allowed to close the connection to your primary server.
  When you create new windows, they will use as their associated
  server whatever was the server for the current window when the new
  window was created.  You can therefore have more than one window for
  any server, but still only one primary server.

  Every time you switch to a new server, it gets
  added to the server list automatically.  To set up initial
  servers in the server list, you can specify them on the command
  line as such:
    irc <nickname> server1 server2 server3
  Each host may have its own port number, password and nickname
  specified on the command line as well:
    irc <nickname> server1:6667 server2:7000:blah server3::foo
  In this case, server1 will use port 6667, server2 will use port
  7000 with password blah, and server3 will use the default port
  number with password foo.  The -p switch on the command line
  allows you to specify the default port number.  Also, if no
  password is specified and one is needed to connect, you will be
  prompted to enter a password before you can connect.  You can
  also specify the default server list in the IRCSERVER
  environment variable using the same format as above.

Available flags:
  -IRC <normal arguments>
  -ICB <normal arguments>
    Make this connection as an IRC or ICB connection.
  -DELETE <number in servers list>
    Allows you to remove servers from the internal server list.
  -GROUP <server_group> <server>
    Set the server group name for the named server to <server_group>
    This allows one to specify which servers to use for any particular
    set of windows.  The server groups are the same as the server_group
    given per window.  If the current server's group is different to
    the current window's server group, behaviour is undefined...
  -SSLNOCHECK <normal arguments>
    Make a connection via SSL, without verifying the server certificate.
  -SSL <normal arguments>
    Make a connection via SSL, verifying the server certificate.
  -NOSSL <normal arguments>
    Make a normal connection, only matters if the default has been set.
