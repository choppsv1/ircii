Usage: SET SAME_WINDOW_ONLY [ON|OFF|TOGGLE]
  Specifies whether or not a channel belonging to a different
  window can become the current channel of a window that has
  just lost its current channel.
  When ON, there is no difference between bound and unbound
  channels since no channel will be moved between windows.
  When OFF, the program will try to find a channel in the
  same window first and, if none is found, then looks for an
  unbound channel in a different window associated to the
  same server.
