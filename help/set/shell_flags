Usage: SET SHELL_FLAGS <flags>
  Sets any additional flags that the shell (set with SET SHELL)
  might need. For most shells the -c flag is needed.  This tells
  the shell to take the command line as a command to be parsed
  rather than a filename.  The flag -f is also added sometimes, and
  with csh and tcsh this means to ignore the .cshrc file when a 
  command is executed.  This means aliases will not be available but
  the command will execute faster.
