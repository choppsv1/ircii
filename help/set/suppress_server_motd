Usage: SET SUPPRESS_SERVER_MOTD [ON|OFF|TOGGLE]
  This will prevent you from seeing the motd from the server when you
  connect to a server.  This is not to be confused with the IRCII motd
  which your installation may or may not have.  You will still see the
  server motd if you use the /MOTD command.
