Usage: TOPIC [<channel>] [<topic for channel>]
  Changes the topic for the named channel.
  You have to be on the channel to change the topic and if
  the channel mode is +t then only a channel-operator can change
  the topic.
  For ICB groups, the <channel> parameter should NOT be included.
  The `default' script distributed with ircII includes an alias to
  handle this automatically.
