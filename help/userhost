Usage: USERHOST <nickname> [<nickname> .. ] [-cmd <command>]
  If only USERHOST nickname is supplied the server will be queried
  for information about that person.  It will return something in
  the format:
    *** Daemon is frechett@spot.Colorado.EDU (Is an IRC operator)
  If -cmd command   is added then it will parse the returned line
  just as though it were an ON or an ALIAS.
  Parameters are:
    $0  nickname
    $1  '+' if server operator, '-' otherwise
    $2  '+' if marked away, '-' if here
    $3  username
    $4  hostname

Note:  Something you may run into if you use this command within an
  ALIAS or ON is the following.  Take the following example.
    alias bonk userhost $0 -cmd echo \($$*\)
  When bonk is called, $0 is expanded to a nickname, and $$* changes to
  $* to be used by userhost -cmd.  However, since the entire expression
  is parsed twice, the \'s are eaten the first time leaving ($*) which
  will never expand.  Thsu to make the above alias work, it has to be:
    alias bonk userhost $0 -cmd echo \\\($$*\\\)
  On the first pass it becomes   userhost nick -cmd echo \($*\)
  and on the second pass when the -cmd part is executed it
  expands and executes   echo (contents of $*)
  This is NOT a special case or a bug.  It is just an added level of
  processing...
