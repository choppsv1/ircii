Usage: WINDOW LEVEL <l>
  Where <l> is a comma separated list of one of the following: 
  CRAP, PUBLIC, MSG, NOTICE, WALL, WALLOP, NOTE, ALL, or NONE.  
  This controls what types of messages will go to the current 
  window.

  No information is ever lost.  Anything that doesn't otherwise
  have a specific window to go to (because it is a window's
  current channel or QUERY user) will either go to the current
  window, or the window whose LEVEL setting contains an
  appropriate type for that message. By default, the first
  window created has a LEVEL of NONE, meaning that no messages
  will go to that window unless otherwise specified.

  Output from NAMES, LIST, WHO... fall under the CRAP category
  for LEVEL. If you want, for example, these messages to always go
  to the current window, you can type this:
    WINDOW LEVEL CRAP
  Now, all "crap" will remain in this window, while all private messages,
  walls, wallops, mail, and notices will go to your current window.
