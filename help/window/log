Usage: WINDOW LOG [ON|OFF|TOGGLE]
  This turns on logging for the current window only.
  If no logfile name has been set with WINDOW LOGFILE,
  the logfile name is created from the current setting of the LOGFILE
  variable and the name of the window channel, query user, or simply
  the word "Window" with the windows internal reference number added
  to the end.  For example, if LOGFILE is set to "IrcLog", and you are
  on channel "#Har", the log file for the window will be "IrcLog.#Har".
