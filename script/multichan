# this is an example script to use to setup multiple channels
# and servers in a relatively working way.  copy this script in
# to your ~.irc/, modify it and add "load multichan" to your
# ~/.ircrc.  you may want to leave the messages window commented.

alias multi.newwin
{
	^window new hide
	^window swap last scroll on level none notify_level dcc,public,msgs,notices,actions
}

# first setup the channels.  in this example we have a total
# of 6 windows:
#	1 - irc on channel #one server local.irc.server.one.com
#	2 - irc on channel #two server local.irc.server.one.com
#	3 - irc on channel #three server far.irc.server.one.com
#	4 - query to dcc chat connection to "nick"
#	5 - icb on group frobnitz to server the.icb.server.com
#	6 - irc dcc & messages for server local.irc.server.one.com
# we set each windows "server group" via the addgroup command
# to some unique name.  this ensures reconnections work properly.

# for each of the below sections, the example code is given a
# double hash comment prefix (##).  you must uncomment and modify
# most of these lines to suit your own setup.

# window 1
# (window 1 is already created; no need to call multi.newwin)
## window addgroup local channel #one bind #one

# window 2
## multi.newwin
## window addgroup local channel #two bind #two

# window 3
## multi.newwin
## window addgroup far channel #three bind #three

# window 4
## multi.newwin
## query =nick

# window 5
## multi.newwin
## window addgroup icb

# create the messages window
# - you may not want to create a message window
# - the "goto 2" below does NOT refer to "window 2".  see
# /help window goto for details.
## window new name msgs level msgs,dcc addgroup local
## window goto 2


# now that we've setup all the channels, it's safe to attempt
# connections to the servers.  (there are strange interactions
# [bugs] in the multi-server code and the code that attempts
# to not hang the client while connecting to the server.)

# the "swap 1", "swap 3" and "swap 5" commands each refer to
# window 1, window 3 and window 5 respectively.
## window swap 1 server local.irc.server.one.com
## window swap 3 server far.irc.server.one.com
## window swap 5 server ICB/the.icb.server.com::::frobnitz


# finally return to the first window, we're done
## window swap 1
