# PINGRELAY Script ------------------------------- [ Usage: /ping <nick> ] ---
# Stores time of ping in message itself instead of in a single local variable.

# CONVERTED for ircII2.2pre6

# Launch time is piggybacked on the PING RELAY request and sent out to the net.
# (The echo *** PING ... line can be taken out, it's just for your information.)

# NOTICE NOTICE NOTICE   the ping alias is now called OPING

eval echo *** Notice:  The ping alias has been changed to OPING
eval echo *** ircII2.2 and beyond have a built in PING command

^alias OPING {
	@ ping.tmp = 0
	while ([$($ping.tmp)])
	{
		ctcp $($ping.tmp) ERRMSG PING RELAY $TIME()
		echo *** PING to $($ping.tmp) launched \( $STIME($TIME()) \)
		@ ping.tmp = ping.tmp + 1
	}
}

# When the PING RELAY comes back, print the time difference (now-launch time)

^on ^ctcp_reply "% % ERRMSG PING RELAY *" {
        echo *** PONG Time to $0: ${time()-[$4]} seconds.
}

# To be warned that you're being pinged, uncomment the following line:
^on ^ctcp "* ERRMSG PING RELAY *" echo *** PING Received a relay ping from $0
# end of script: PINGRELAY
