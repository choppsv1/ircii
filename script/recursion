# This one from Daemon (frechett@spot.Colorado.EDU)
# He also threw together the patch to allow this sort of thing.

# For use with the recursion abilities of ircII2.2pre5+2 
# set MAX_RECURSIONS however high you want and still think is safe for you.
# Or use it as a limit to the number of times an alias will execute.  It will
# die with an error though.

# /iterate command_word list_of_words
# will execute the command for each word in order
^alias iterate
{
	if ([$1]) {$0 $1;iterate $0 $2-}
}

# /conbunch server1 server2 server3
^alias conbunch
{
	if ( [$1] ) 
		{ conbunch $1- }
	connect $0
}

# /kickbunch nick1 nick2 nick3 nick4
^alias kickbunch
{
	if ( [$1] )
		{ kickbunch $1-}
	kick $C $0
}

# you get the point
^alias squitbunch
{
	if ( [$1] )
		{ squitbunch $1- }
	squit $0
}

^alias versbunch
{
	if ( [$1] )
		{ versbunch $1- }
	version $0
}

# /opalot + nick1 nick2 nick3     or /opalot - nick1 nick2 nick3  for op or deop
# It will op in an efficient fashion as well.
^alias opalot

	if ( [$4] )
		{ opalot $0 $4- }

# /addlist <listname> word1 word2 word3           add to array

# not related to recursion directly but useful for dealing with arrays.
# /do <list name> <action for element>
^alias do foreach $0 ii \{ $1- $$($0[$$ii]) \}

# /clean <structure name>
# removes all assignments under that name to a single level
^alias clean foreach $0 ii { assign -$0[$ii] }

# removes all assignments under that name recursively.
^alias purge {

# Assuming  you've made a list with addlist of servers.. or people or whatever
# the following alias should give you some idea of other things to do..
^alias versall do $0 version

# Yes.. it looks cryptic.. Try /addlist servers h.ece* ucsu* *.unm.edu
# and then /versall servers
# or maybe just type /do servers version         ;)

# so much more.. so little time..
