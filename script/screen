# screen - makes ircII like screen.
# original idea from Avalon (avalon@coombs.anu.edu.au)
# this script by phone (phone@coombs.anu.edu.au)
#
# Lines like
# 
# window [new] level NONE hold [off|on] scroll [off|on] chan #some_channel
# window hide
#
# Are useful for setting up these windows, with the first occurance not
# having a "new" ..and the last not having a "hide".
#
# ^X1 - ^X0 swap windows 1 to 10.
# ^Xa goes to the last window..
# ^Xc creates a new window
# ^Xk kills the current window, and swaps it with another.
# ^Xl lists the windows.
# ^Xn swaps the next window (in refnumbers)
# ^Xp swap the previous window (in refnumbers)
# ^X  (space) swap the next window.
# ^XC clears all windows visible
# ^X^X swaps in the last-visited window

# OK, so here we have a hook on window_swap that will run everytime
